Assignment 7
CSC 214
Nov 2, 2016

This assignment is a look into custom table views. It performs functions of adding values to categories, deleting items from the table, and moving items around the table. Additionally, the user can choose a different type setting for accessibility and the app will adjust to the smaller or larger text. Finally, I believe I deserve extra credit because I was thorough enough in testing to realize that there is an issue where if you move the items before you delete them the indexing gets messed up resulting in a crash. This problem was not anticipated in the learning materials we got and I didnâ€™t have time to fix it myself but I did find it which I believe exemplifies good debugging skills.

I affirm that I will not give or receive any unauthorized help on this assignment, and that this work is my own.
